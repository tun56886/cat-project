# cat-project

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am making a cat tamagotchi game where the player can watch their cat grow up.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No.

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tamacatchi

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The player will be able to raise their own kitty into a cat. This involves feeding the cat, bathing the cat, playing with the cat, and letting their cat sleep.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using Ren'Py to do my project. I will make it like a story game where the player will have to complete actions to get their kitty to grow into a cat. I will likely use an experience bar system where each action earns experience to further the cat's progress in life. I will prompt the player to choose actions to complete in the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish implementing a cat into the game that the user can take care of.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to add all the features I want into the game, such as food, toys, baths, and sleep. I would also like to add a customizable cat feature.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to also add a happiness meter into the game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use Ren'Py to implement my game. I will need to research how to code something like an experience bar into the game.
